## Lincoln Dark (an introduction by Lincoln Dark)

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Hello, as the heading suggests, my name is Lincoln Dark. I am an M.S Candidate at The University of Rhode Island studying Environmental Science and Management with a specialization in Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis.

Both professionally and recreationally, I am **very** passionate about ornithology. Currently, I am serving in AmeriCorps with The Audubon Society of Rhode Island where I coordinate our Eastern Bluebird Nest Box Monitoring Program. In this program, I recruit and train volunteers on how to collect data on Eastern Bluebird productivity on our wildlife refuges. Furthermore, I am responsible for _all_ of the data management. fun stuff. Outside of my profession, I enjoy chasing after rare birds all over New England. I even saw the newsworthy Steller's Sea Eagle when it was in Massachusetts in Early December 2021.

I do not have any experience coding in Python; however, I am enthusiastic to learn this program. In the future, I hope to apply Python in data analysis of avian research projects.
