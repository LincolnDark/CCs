Lincoln Dark - April 20th, 2022 - NRS 528 - Final Toolbox README

The purpose of this toolbox is to provide the user with three tools that can be used to identify coastal areas in their state
or province that is suitable breeding habitat for the Canada Warbler. The Canada Warbler is a migratory songbird that
has faced a population loss of over 62% since 1966 (Reitsma et. al, 2020). Due to this unfortunate fact, it is of the
utmost importance to identify suitable breeding habitat for this species and protect these areas to prevent further
population decline.

Below are the descriptions of the tools
Tool 1 - Buffering the coastline by 5 miles, this is an arbitrary distance to be used to define coastal areas.

Tool 2 - Selecting all forested wetlands from a wetlands dataset.

Tool 3 - Clip the forested wetlands to the buffered coastline to identify all forested wetlands in the coastal area.
