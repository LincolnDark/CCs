Lincoln Dark - April 20th, 2022 - NRS 528 - Final Toolbox README

The purpose of this toolbox is to provide the user with three tools that can be used to identify areas in their state
or province that is suitable breeding habitat for the Canada Warbler. The Canada Warbler is a migratory songbird that
has faced a population loss of over 62% since 1966 (Reitsma et. al, 2020). Due to this unfortunate fact, it is of the
utmost importance to identify suitable breeding habitat for this species and protect these areas to prevent further
population decline.

I was inspired to pursue this project because in a recent discussion with Dr. Charles Clarkson, the Director of
Avian Research of The Audubon Society of Rhode Island and former coordinator of the Rhode Island Bird Atlas,
he informed me that birds use the interior of the state during migration much more than ornithologists previously
thought, especially the Canada Warbler. Upon learning this, I became interested in studying other ways the
Canada Warbler may use the interior of our state in greater than expected frequencies, such as breeding.

Below are the descriptions of the tools
Tool 1 - Defining the study area, this will select all areas that are 10 miles or greater from the coastline.

Tool 2 - (2 parts)
2a - Select all forested wetlands from the wetlands data set -> clip this land cover type to the study area ->
    convert this feature class to a raster format -> region group -> reclassify the raster based on area
2b - Buffer all roads in the state by 4 distances; 328 feet, 984 feet, 3280 feet, and 50,000 feet -> use the intersect
tool so the distance between each buffer distance becomes it's own feature (i.e 328-984 feet from a road will be a
single feature) -> convert these features to raster format -> reclassify the raster based on distance to the road

Tool 3 - Using the raster calculator to determine the suitability score of each area, weighing distance to road and
forested wetland size.
